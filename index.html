Oh, Hello there.

This is a personal website. Its purpose is not to be full of
features, but rather to tell visitors where they can find me.

The list is rather short at the moment, simply because I
don't write much. Most of the stuff I do right now is either 
incomplete, or not comitted, because it is still a work in
progress.

I intend to finish what I started, in the course of this year,
2015.

Oh, and minimalism rules. We need more of it in our lives. It
may be the only way we can have to counteract the effects of
consumerism, and all the bad repercutions it has on our lives.

PS: Why does CSS have to be so ugly? Serisously, there's literally
    "Cascading" in it, and we can't nest the definitions. What
    sense does that make?
